# webscraper

I wanted to build my very own webscraper in Python using the Beautiful Soup library.

In this exercise, I wanted to:

+ Be able to scrape from different sources.
+ Have the flexibility to easily add and remove sources.
+ Reuse code where possible, only writing custom parsing for each source.

Considerations:

+ Note that some bot detections such as Imperva will detect certain scraping frameworks.
